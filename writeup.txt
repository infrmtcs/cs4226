controller.py:
This controller divides the packets into cases:
- If it's multicast, flood the packet.
- If the communication between 2 hosts are banned, a flow with no action will be installed. Otherwise,
- If the switch is s2 or s3, it will forward to port 1 if the packets are for h1 or h2, and port 2 if they are for h3 and h4. Otherwise,
- If the switch is s1 or s4, select and install the flow based on the port in source and destination.
